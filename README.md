## References
We used basic JavaFX concepts from [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston) on YouTube, where we used the concepts for the driver class and ConfirmBox class.

The structure of the game is based off of the [Picasso](https://github.com/Hopding/Picasso) game by Andrew Dillon, also known as Hopding on GitHub. We took the player movements, camera movements, and project structure from that repository.
